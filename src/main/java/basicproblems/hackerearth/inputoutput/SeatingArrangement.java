/**
 * Akash and Vishal are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. They were travelling in a train one day and they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. The compartment looked something like
 * <p>
 * Seating Arrangement image address : https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/a2e0794.jpg
 * <p>
 * So they got interested to know the seat number facing them and the seat type facing them. The seats are denoted as follows :
 * <p>
 * Window Seat : WS
 * Middle Seat : MS
 * Aisle Seat : AS
 * <p>
 * You will be given a seat number, find out the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. WS, MS or AS.
 * <p>
 * INPUT
 * First line of input will consist of a single integer T denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer N denoting the seat-number.
 * <p>
 * OUTPUT
 * For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat-type, separated by a single space in a new line.
 * <p>
 * CONSTRAINTS
 * 1<=T<=105
 * 1<=N<=108
 * SAMPLE INPUT
 * 2
 * 18
 * 40
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT
 * 19 WS
 * 45 AS
